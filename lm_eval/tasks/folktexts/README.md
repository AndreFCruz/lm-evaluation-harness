### Checklist

For adding novel benchmarks/datasets to the library:
* [X] Is the task an existing benchmark in the literature?
  * [X] Have you referenced the original paper that introduced the task?
  * [X] If yes, does the original paper provide a reference implementation? If so, have you checked against the reference implementation and documented how to run such a test?


If other tasks on this dataset are already supported:
* [X] Is the "Main" variant of this task clearly denoted?
* [X] Have you provided a short sentence in a README on what each new variant adds / evaluates?
* [X] Have you noted which, if any, published evaluation setups are matched by this variant?
